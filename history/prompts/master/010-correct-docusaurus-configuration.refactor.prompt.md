## Prompt

when i run the project by npm run start it shows me template of dousoruse toutorial instead of my project please cheak and make correct

## Response snapshot

The Docusaurus configuration has been updated to correctly display the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book content. Instructions to re-run the development server have been provided.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Corrected Docusaurus configuration to display generated book content.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (Manual verification by user expected)
- 📁 Files: Modified `physical-ai-book/docusaurus/docusaurus.config.ts`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will re-run Docusaurus server.
- 🧠 Reflection: The initial Docusaurus setup required manual configuration adjustments to correctly point to the generated `docs` content and reflect project branding.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Default Docusaurus `navbar` and `footer` links pointed to tutorial content, despite `sidebars.ts` being autogenerated.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- next_experiment: none
