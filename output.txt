The Docusaurus configuration (`physical-ai-book/docusaurus/docusaurus.config.ts`) has been updated to correctly display the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book content and information.

Please navigate to the `physical-ai-book/docusaurus` directory in your terminal and run the development server again:

```bash
cd physical-ai-book\docusaurus
npm run start
```

You should now see the generated book content at `http://localhost:3000`.
