## Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI

### Summary
This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI. We'll explore what "embodied intelligence" means and how it differs from purely digital AI like ChatGPT. We will establish a mental model for how a robot perceives and acts in the world, setting the stage for the technical deep dive into ROS 2.

### Why This Chapter Matters
Before you can write a single line of robotic code, you need to understand the paradigm you're working in. This chapter provides that essential context. It builds the "why" behind the "how," ensuring you appreciate the challenges and opportunities of making AI physically manifest.

### Real Robotics Use-Cases
- **Warehouse Automation**: Robots that can see, grasp, and move packages need a foundational understanding of their physical presence.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: A self-driving car is the ultimate example of embodied AI, constantly sensing its environment to make critical decisions.
- **Healthcare Assistants**: Robotic assistants in hospitals must be able to navigate complex, dynamic human environments safely.

### Skills Students Will Build
- A clear definition of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence.
- The ability to differentiate between different types of robotic sensors and their functions.
- A conceptual framework for robot agency and decision-making.
