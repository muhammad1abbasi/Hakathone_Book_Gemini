## Chapter 1: Gazebo Basics

### Summary
This chapter is your hands-on introduction to the Gazebo robotics simulator. You will learn how to install Gazebo, launch a pre-made world, and interact with the environment. We will explore the Gazebo user interface and learn how to create our own simple "world" file, defining the ground plane, lighting, and basic shapes.

### Why This Chapter Matters
Gazebo is one of the most powerful and widely-used tools in robotics. It provides a robust physics engine and sensor simulation, allowing you to test your robot in a realistic virtual environment. Before you can simulate your complex humanoid robot, you must first master the basics of the simulator itself. This chapter builds that essential foundation.

### Real Robotics Use-Cases
- **Algorithm Testing**: Using a simulated world to test a new navigation or object-detection algorithm before running it on a real robot.
- **Environment Design**: Creating a virtual replica of a real-world factory floor or a home environment to train a robot for a specific task.
- **Regression Testing**: Automatically running a suite of simulation tests every time code is changed to ensure no new bugs were introduced.

### Skills Students Will Build
- Ability to install and run the Gazebo simulator.
- Familiarity with the Gazebo user interface, including navigating the 3D view.
- Understanding of the SDF (Simulation Description Format) used to define worlds.
- Skill in writing a simple `.world` file to add basic shapes, lighting, and physics properties.
